This is a small project designed to take Wordpress entries and import them into toto.  All that is needed is toto and an exported XML file from your Wordpress blog.

'import.rb' takes a command-line argument: the XML file to be imported into toto.

toto currently only supports posts.  It does not support drafts, pages, or comments natively.  In order to preserve your comments, I'd recommend installing the Disqus plugin for Wordpress and exporting all of your comments to it.

this script expects an articles directory and writes out the default slugified posts that is is able to parse.

switched from rexml to hpricot, but don't remember why.  Had this laying around for about 6 months.
